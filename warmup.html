		      		<h3>Text Instruction</h3>
		      		<h4>Jumping Rope</h4>
		      		<p>1. Choose the right rope. You should find a rope that reaches nearly up to your shoulders when it's folded in half. This will give you enough room to comfortably jump over it, but not so much that you trip over the rope. The rope should have handles that are easy to grip and shouldn't be too light or too heavy.</p>
		      		<p>2. Stand up and pick up the rope. Hold the rope's handles in each of your hands. Extend your hands and forearms at least a foot away from your body, at a 45 degree angle. This will create a larger arc for you to jump through.</p>
		      		<p>3. Step over the rope. The rope should hang behind you, so that the middle of the rope hits the back of your feet.</p>
		      		<p>4. Use your hands and wrists to swing the rope over your head. Don't move your arms -- try to keep the motion limited to your wrists.</p>
		      		<p>5. When the rope is coming toward the front of your feet, hop over it. Stand on your tiptoes, and push off with the balls of your feet. Try to keep the motion in your ankles. Bending your knees to jump will make the exercise a lot harder.</p>
		      		<p>6. Set a pace that works for you. For beginners, it's best to move the rope slowly, so that you have enough time to take a small hop in between each jump over the rope. Maintain a straight back and keep your gaze set straight ahead as you fall into the correct rhythm. If you watch your feet as you jump, you'll be more likely to get off balance. As your skill increases, you can swing the rope more quickly and eliminate the middle hop. As you improve your skills, you can count how long you can go without messing up. A fun way to track your progress is to count how many skips you can do in one stretch, without fumbling. Listen to your body. If you're feeling discomfort in your joints, it's better to decrease the exercise intensity. On the other hand, if you're feeling great and want to extend the exercise session, you can do that as well.</p>
		      		<h4>Jumping Jacks</h4>
		      		<p>1. Stand upright with your legs together, arms at your sides.</p>
		      		<p>2. Bend your knees slightly, and jump into the air.</p>
		      		<p>3. As you jump, spread your legs to be about shoulder-width apart. Stretch your arms out and over your head.</p>
		      		<p>Jump back to starting position.</p>
		      		<p>Repeat.</p>
		      		<h4>Knee Lifts</h4>
		      		<p>1. Stand upright with your knees hip-width apart. Get into a comfortable standing position with your back straight and tall and your shoulders squared. Plant your feet so theyâ€™re slightly apart, and keep your knees lined up under your hips. If you have trouble balancing, you can do this exercise while standing next to a chair or counter and rest your hand on it for support.</p>
		      		<p>2. Brace your core muscles. Gently tense the muscles in your abdomen, sides, and lower back. Engaging these muscles will help you build strength in your core. To find your core muscles, imagine creating a firm band or belt of muscle around your lower body. You can also try pulling your belly button in towards your spine. This exercise also helps strengthen your hips.</p>
		      		<p>3. Raise one knee until your thigh is level with the floor. Breathe in deeply, then breathe out as you slowly raise one of your knees. Lift your leg until the back of your thigh is parallel with the floor. Keep your back straight and tall as you lift your leg.</p>
		      		<p>4. Hold for 1-2 seconds before returning to the start position. Pause for a second or 2 with your knee raised. Then, slowly and smoothly put your foot back on the floor while breathing out.</p>
		      		<p>5. Switch to the other leg and repeat. After raising and lowering one knee, repeat the same process on the other side. Or, you can do several raises on one side, then switch to the other. Do 1-2 sets of 10-15 reps, either alternating knees or doing one side and then the other as separate sets. To make the exercise more challenging, you can try doing more reps or adding small weights to your ankles.</p>
